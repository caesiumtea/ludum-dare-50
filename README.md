# ludum-dare-50
early draft of a narrative game about a witch's last week at magical study abroad   
created (but not submitted) for Ludum Dare 50, on the theme *delay the inevitable*    

there's not much here. i tried to learn Javascript for the first time *during the game jam*, which went about as well as you would expect. but hopefully i'll return to this project eventually!

[read the design document in my digital garden repo](https://github.com/caesiumtea/entropic-garden/blob/main/entropic-garden/notes/witch-game.md) (it's about the only aspect of the project that i actually completed during the game jam lmao)
